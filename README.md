## Game Description

You’ve been planning this for ages. It's finally time to set things right. After years of being falsely accused and unjustly imprisoned, feeling as if the entire world has conspired against you, there's only one course of action that makes sense: ESCAPE.

Challenge your mind in this immersive experience, times running out, the clock is ticking, and it won’t be long till it’s too late. 

Items scattered throughout the prison aren't just random objects; they're potential keys to your liberation. The ability to pick up and utilize these items is paramount to crafting an escape route. 

Planned Your Escape, Now Claim Your Freedom!
